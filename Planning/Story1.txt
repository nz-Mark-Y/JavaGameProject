Chapter 1:

-I see you are a worthy opponent however this won't be enough to defeat me, the legendary emperor Rob

*You ignore Rob*

Rob: You may have defeated my fleet today but know that this is your last victory.
     Enjoy this moment while you still can for none shall oppose Rob!

Savi: I don't think so, Rob.
      You see we have a secret weapon you don't have: 

*Savi points at you*

Savi: This legendary commander!
      Not even you can defeat him.

Rob: Are you that sure in yourself?
     You see, I also have a secret weapon:
     I have kidnapped his whole family.

Savi: How cruel!

*You stare blankly*

Rob: Even his pet sheep is part of my hostage collection!

*You suddenly glare at Rob*

Rob: A-anyways, if you interfere with my plans of conquering the whole galaxy with my zombie army again, don't think I will be as nice.

Savi: We'll see about that.
