Introduction:

-Commander, are you okay?

*You throw a confused look*

-It's me, Savi, your best friend! 

Savi: Why are you, the commander prodigy, spacing out for?
      Come on, there is an enemy attack, go to your battle station!

*You look even more confused*

Savi: Are you still dreaming? Hello, britain is at war! 
      We're the only country that survived that weird zombie apocalypse.
      Don't you remember?

*You shake your head*

Savi: You seriously don't remember anything?

*You shake your head again*

Savi: Hmm, maybe going to fight might wake you up.
      All you have to do is protect the mothership [In the top right corner] from the 
      virus probe [Ball] by using your ship [Use A and D for movement, W for powerup].
      Come on, we have an enemy attack to take care of!
