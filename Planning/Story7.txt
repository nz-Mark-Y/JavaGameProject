Chapter 7:

Jake: Domine deus meus in te speravi conlitebor tibi domine in toto 
      corde meo quem ad modum desiderat cervus ad fantes aquarum. 
      Ouver! Chameron! Aliseon! Mandousin! Premy! Oriet! Mayorus! Esmony! 
      Estiot! Dumosson! Danochar! Casmiel! Sadirno! Eparinesant! 
      Domine meus Lucifer!

Gary: Not so fast, Jake!

Jake: You are getting on my nerves like no one has ever been.
      It's about time I payed you back for all the pain you've given me:
      Goodbye hostages!

*Jake shoots all your family members*

Jake: Hahahahaha, I warned you, get in my way, pay the price!
      I'll let you keep your pet sheep as a memento.

Gary: HOW COULD YOU, YOU EVIL BEING!

Jake: Me, evil? Am I hearing that correctly?
      Is the empire that eradicated over 300 races really accusing me of being evil?
      Makes you wonder what's worse, a few sacrifices or 300 genocides...

Gary: But that's different!

Jake: How so? By saying it was for "safety"?
      You just can't face reality, you are too weak to do so!
      In any case, you are too late, I have fully ascended.
      All shall bow to Jake the Dark Overlord!

Gary: We won't fail here!
      Let's go commander, let's finish this once and for all!
