Chapter 3:

Jake: Dog Gamete, we were too late, not even a single bone remains..
      If only we had arrived sooner...

Rob: Hahahahaha, I did warn you, my power is absolute!

Jake: YOU! HOW DARE YOU!

Rob: Oh boohoo, you lost your little friends.
     I did warn you though: stop interfering with my plans, this is my last warning!
     Otherwise I might have more "creative" ideas for my hostages...

Jake: WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SWEAR IF YOU -

Rob: In any case, don't worry too much about it, you will soon be joining all of them!

Jake: Oh no, an ambush! Quick commander, let's go!
