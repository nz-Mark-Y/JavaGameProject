Chapter 2:

-Urgent news commander: the recon team has been ambushed by enemy forces. What are your orders?

Jake: where are they positioned?

-In hostile territory, sir! Their chances of survival if we do not interfere is zero!

Jake: Dog Gamete! We must help them!
      Commander, let's dispatch a rescue unit.
      No, wait, that will spread out forces, we can barely afford to dispatch one ship.

*You stare at the ceiling*

Jake: That's it! If only us two go together, we won't compromise our forces and succeed in bringing them back!
      Do be careful: they were stationed near where the apocalypse started, radiation levels may be unusually high.
      If only the scientific experiment which caused all this had been stopped earlier...
      Anyways, let's go rescue the recon team!
