Chapter 6:

Jake: I am getting really tired of you interfering, you know that?
      I should put those hostages to use, I need to be left alone for a while.

Gary: I don't think so Jake, we're here to stop you!

Jake: So this is your backup? I should have guessed it: it's pathetic.

Gary: Why should we leave you alone? You're trying to take over the world!

Jake: Actually, I'm trying to take over the galaxy, get your facts right.
      Also, I never said I needed the blood of the princess while she was alive...

Gary: You don't mean...

Jake: That's right I will ascend as an overlord after the summoning ritual succeeds
      In the meantime, my army is sure to keep you busy.

Gary: Darn, we must get past them before he finishes the ritual.
      On a positive note, we did manage to rescue the hostages.
      However, we can't rest here, we must stop Jake!
