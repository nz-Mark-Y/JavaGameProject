Chapter 4:

Jake: Well we made it through the ambush, lucky us!
      Huh, that's strange I can't contact HQ, I hope nothing bad's happened whiel we were gone.

*You arrive back at HQ*

Jake: What? How? Why?

Rob: Guess who warned you? That's right me!
     If only you had listened to me and obeyed...

Jake: We would be dead if we had done that!

Rob: Heh, details.
     Anyways, I kidnapped your precious princess.

Jake: WHAT???

Rob: Well, it's more like she's the only survivor of my surprise attack.

Jake: Why are you involving her? She has nothing to do with all this!

Rob: You do know that to ascend as a overlord you need the blood of a princess, right?

Jake: What are you on about? These are just myths!

Rob: We'll see about that.

Jake: Commander, please go rescue the princess. I'll look for survivors here in the meantime.
