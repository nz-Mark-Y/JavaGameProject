Chapter 5:

Rob: You sure are a persitent one, aren't you?
     Coming in my base while your little friend calls for backup, not bad for a desperate strategy.

*You ignore Rob*

Rob: However, this won't be enough to kill me.
     You see, I have cloned myself and although this clone right here will die, I still have a spare one.
     It is even someone you knew all along.

*You raise an eyebrow*

Rob: You see, Jake is an excellent actor: drawing you away from HQ so I can attack it, giving you a poison erasing your memories...
     You don't seem very impressed. Let me help you with that...

*Rob shoots the princess*

Rob: Now that I made sure you failed in your mission, I can die in peace...

*Rob drops dead*

*You go back to HQ but can't find Jake*

-Commander, you're alright! I bring the reinforcements requested.

*You throw a confused look*

-It's me Gary! Dispatched with my unit as per your request!

Gary: From what I understand from the situation, something is clear: we must find and stop Jake.
      I just hope the ascension Rob was talking about was a hoax...
